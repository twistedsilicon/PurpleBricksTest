Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) in ReactJS
This repo contains an implementation of the Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) functionality, written
using ReactJs as the front end and Azure Mobile App DataServices as the cloud datastore.

It allows the user to create TCCC "cases" identifying the patient, vital signs and other relevant bits of
information and send sync them with the Azure cloud service.
