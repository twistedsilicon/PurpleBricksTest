            <p>A example of using Terry Woodruffs React Framework to build a property management website</p>
            <p>This provided a basic skeleton to hang a React based web app that uses Azure Mobile app framework for it's datastore</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href='https://get.asp.net/'>ASP.NET Core</a> and <a href='https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx'>C#</a> for cross-platform server-side code</li>
                <li><a href='https://facebook.github.io/react/'>React</a>, <a href='http://redux.js.org'>Redux</a>, and <a href='http://www.typescriptlang.org/'>TypeScript</a> for client-side code</li>
                <li><a href='https://webpack.github.io/'>Webpack</a> for building and bundling client-side resources</li>
                <li><a href='http://getbootstrap.com/'>Bootstrap</a> for layout and styling</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It allows you to record basic details of a property, address, postcode, number of bedrooms, offer price etc, and edit them.</p>
            <p>Click on the properties for sale menu item, to see a list of properties that are seeded into the database</p>
            <p>Feel Free to add some more!</p>
            <p>You can use the sync button to make the backend go back to azure datastore and update with any data it finds there.</p>
            <p>To help you get started, we've also set up:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Client-side navigation</strong>. For example, click <em>Counter</em> then <em>Back</em> to return here.</li>
                <li><strong>Webpack dev middleware</strong>. In development mode, there's no need to run the <code>webpack</code> build tool. Your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand. Updates are available as soon as you modify any file.</li>
                <li><strong>Hot module replacement</strong>. In development mode, you don't even need to reload the page after making most changes. Within seconds of saving changes to files, rebuilt React components will be injected directly into your running application, preserving its live state.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient production builds</strong>. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and the <code>webpack</code> build tool produces minified static CSS and JavaScript files.</li>
                <li><strong>Server-side prerendering</strong>. To optimize startup time, your React application is first rendered on the server. The initial HTML and state is then transferred to the browser, where client-side code picks up where the server left off.</li>
                <li><strong>Offline Sync</strong>. Allows you to store and update data whilst offline, and then to sync it back once back online to a Microsoft Azure Mobile Web App backend.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>;
